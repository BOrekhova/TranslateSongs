----------------------------------------

**_I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more "shotty"  
I bet a lot of me was lost, "T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s undotted  
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got  
Not any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!  
I must've forgot, you can't trust me  
I'm open a moment and closed when you show it  
Before you know it, I'm lost at sea  
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds  
You should take my life, you should take my soul_**  

Я возвращаю себе контроль над своим телом, никаких больше неосознанных решений.  


**_You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes
And I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you_**

**_Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin'
'Cause the next moment before you know it
Time is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?
You think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it
Tie a noose around your mind, loose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree tell it, "You belong to me
This ain't a noose, this is a leash
And I have news for you, you must obey me!"_**

**_You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Sounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain
You are surrounding, all my surroundings
Twisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes_**

**_Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith
Entertain my faith, entertain my faith_**

**_Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hard, it's our hearts that make the beat
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it?
Lyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat?
It ain't the speakers that bump hearts, and it's our hearts that make the beat_**

**_And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you
And I'll be holding onto you, and I'll be holding onto you_**
