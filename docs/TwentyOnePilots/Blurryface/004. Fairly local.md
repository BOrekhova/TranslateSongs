**Fairly local**
<p>
Twenty One Pilots / Album Blurryface

----------------------------------------

**_I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now_**

Я почти местный, Я часто бывал тут,  
Я видел улицы, по которым ты гуляешь,  
Добрые люди, Я почти местный (я свой)  

**_I'm evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will
They say I'm emotional, what I want to save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat an' repeat yesterday's dance_**

**_Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional_**

**_I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now_**

Я почти местный, Я часто бывал тут,  
Я видел улицы, по которым ты гуляешь,  
Добрые люди, Я почти местный (я свой)  

**_I'm not evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will fight
I know I'm emotional, what I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat to avoid yesterday's dance_**

**_Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral
The world around us is burnin' but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, an' the emotional_**

**_I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walkin' down

Добрые люди, Я почти местный (я свой)
