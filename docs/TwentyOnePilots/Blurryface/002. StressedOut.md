**Stressed Out**
<p>
Twenty One Pilots / Album Blurryface

----------------------------------------

**_I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard  
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words  
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new  
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang  
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink  
But now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think_**  

Хотел бы я найти лучшие звуки, которые никто никогда не слышал,  
Хотелось бы иметь хороший голос, чтобы петь лучшие слова,  
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**_My name's Blurryface and I care what you think  
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think_**  

Меня зовут Blurryface и мне важно ваше мнение,  
Меня зовут Blurryface и мне важно ваше мнение  

**_Wish we could turn back time to the good old days  
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out  
(Oh) Wish we could turn back time (Oh) to the good old days (Oh)  
When our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out  
We're stressed out_**  

**_Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young  
How come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?  
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it  
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one  
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose  
Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam  
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered  
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter_**  

**_My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think  
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think_**

**_We used to play pretend, give each other different names  
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away  
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face  
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah  
We used to play pretend, give each other different names  
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away  
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face  
Sayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!," yeah_**

Хотелось бы вернуться назад в те старые добрые времена,
Когда мама пела нам колыбельные, а сейчас мы подавлены,  
Хотелось бы вернуться назад в те старые добрые времена,
Когда мама пела нам колыбельные, а сейчас мы подавлены  

**_We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money  
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money  
Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money  
We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money  
Used to play pretend, give each other different names  
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away  
Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face
