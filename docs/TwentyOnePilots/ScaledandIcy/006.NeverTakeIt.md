**Never Take It**
<p>
Twenty One Pilots / Album Scaled and Icy
</p>  
----------------------------------------

**_Now that they know information (Information)  
Is just a currency and nothing more  
Keep the truth in quotations (In quotations)  
'Cause they keep lying through their fake teeth_**  

То, что они знают сейчас -  
Это валюта и ничего более,  
Заключай правду в кавычки,  
Ведь другие продолжают бессовестно врать, демонстрируя фальшь.  

**_Oh-oh-oh, they're trying hard to weaponize  
You and I, we'll never take it  
Oh-oh-oh, they're asking for a second try  
You and I will never take it_**  

Они усердно пытаются вооружить,  
Тебя и меня, но мы никогда не поведемся на это,  
Они просят дать им еще шанс,  
Но ты и я никогда не поведемся на это  

**_Why cure disease of confusion (Of confusion)  
When you're the treatment facility?  
How can we seek restitution (Restitution)  
When they keep lying through their fake teeth?_**  

**_Oh-oh-oh, they're trying hard to weaponize  
You and I, we'll nеver take it  
Oh-oh-oh, they'rе asking for a second try  
You and I will never take it (Yeah, ah-ah-ah)  
Will never take it
Oh-oh-oh, they're asking for a second try  
You and I will never take it from 'em_**  

Они усердно пытаются вооружить,  
Тебя и меня, но мы никогда не поведемся на это,  
Они просят дать им еще шанс,  
Но ты и я никогда не поведемся на это  

**_The summer I watched the tube, I saw enough  
Taught myself to play guitar, tearing it up  
And my advice on those two things that I picked up  
You better educate yourself, but never too much  
The summer I watched the tube (Ooh-ooh), I saw enough (I saw enough)  
Taught myself to play guitar (Ooh-ooh), tearing it up (Tearing it up)  
And my advice on those two things (Ooh-ooh) that I picked up (I picked up)  
You better educate yourself (Ooh), but never too much (Never too much)_**  

**_(Weaponize, you and I)  
Never take it, oh-oh-oh  
They profit from a great divide  
You and I will never take it_**  

**_Oh-oh-oh, they're trying hard to weaponize  
You and I, we'll never take it  
Oh-oh-oh, they're asking for a second try  
You and I will never take it_**  

Они усердно пытаются вооружить,  
Тебя и меня, но мы никогда не поведемся на это,  
Они просят дать им еще шанс,  
Но ты и я никогда не поведемся на это

In short, this song could be taken as a critique about the intentional divisiveness and toxicity of modern media. Media corporations profit off of people’s disagreements over politics, religion, sexuality, the 2020 pandemic, etc.  
“They [the media] profit from a great divide”; “information is just a currency and nothing more” to the media.  
The media “keep[s] the truth in quotations” that are too short to tell the whole story and that causes more cultural divisiveness.  

The chorus is a wise reminder to NOT BELIEVE WHAT YOU SEE ON TV, and not to take whatever brand of world-image the media you consume is trying to push on you. Don’t take the sweet, short, tasty, and convenient opinions. Do the work and formulate your own beliefs.  

The bridge near the end is Tyler’s personal example of not watching too much media during the COVID-19 pandemic for his own mental health. He distracted himself in a healthy way by learning to play the guitar.  

The song could also be reflective of the culture within the city of DEMA and the story of Trench, but from what I can see, there is not conclusive proof of this from the lyrics alone.
