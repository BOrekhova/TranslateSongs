-----------------------------------------

**_When I get home  
You better not be there  
We're placin' bets you won't_**  

**_Shed your modesty  
And the only thing to leave behind  
Is your own skin on the floor_**  

**_Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)  
Manifest a ceiling  
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)  
Searchin' for that feelin'  
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)  
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)  
Like a song he wrote that's never heard (Ah-ah-ah)  
Don't you sh..._**  

**_When you get home  
You barely recognize the pictures  
They put in a frame_**  

**_'Cause you shed your modеsty  
Don't circle the track  
Take what you havе  
And leave your skin on the floor_**  

**_Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)  
Manifest a ceiling  
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)  
Searchin' for that feelin'  
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)  
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)  
Like a song he wrote (Ah-ah-ah)  
That's never heard_**  

**_When I get home  
Boy, you better not be there  
You're long gone_**  

**_Shed your modesty  
Don't circle the track  
Just break the cycle in half  
And leave your skin on the floor_**  

**_Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)  
Manifest a ceiling  
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)  
Searchin' for that feelin'  
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)  
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)  
Like a song he wrote (Ah-ah-ah)  
That's never heard  
That's never heard (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)_**
