**_I can feel my saturation  
Leaving me slowly  
Broke the news on Mom's vacation  
Oh, but you know me_**  

**_Low-key, I'm alright  
Would you say you depend on the weather?  
My sunshine  
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out  
I know it's hard to believe me, it's a good day_**  

**_Lost my job, my wife and child  
Homie just sued me  
Shoot my life in shoot-'em-up style  
Her favorite movies_**  

**_Low-key, I'm alright  
Would you say you depend on the weather?  
My sunshine  
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out  
I know it's hard to believe me, it's a good day_**  

**_Today's a good day, never know, never know  
When the next one will show, it'll show  
So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul (Da-da-da)  
Today's a good day, never know, never know  
When the next one will show, it'll show  
So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul, yeah  
(So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul)_**  

**_I'm alright  
Would you say you depend on the weather?  
My sunshine  
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out  
I know it's hard to believe me, it's a good day_**  

**_I'm alright  
I'm alright  
I think that I'm alright  
It's a good day_**
