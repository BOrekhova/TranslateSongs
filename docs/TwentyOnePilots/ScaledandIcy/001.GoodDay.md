----------------------------------------

**_I can feel my saturation  
Leaving me slowly  
Broke the news on Mom's vacation  
Oh, but you know me_**  

Чувствую как постепенно  
Я теряю свою насыщенность,  
Эту новость сообщили во время отпуска мамы.
Ох, но ты меня знаешь.

**_Low-key, I'm alright  
Would you say you depend on the weather?  
My sunshine  
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out  
I know it's hard to believe me, it's a good day_**  

По секрету, я в порядке  
Скажете ли вы, что зависите от погоды?  
...

wtf 

...

**_Lost my job, my wife and child  
Homie just sued me  
Shoot my life in shoot-'em-up style  
Her favorite movies_**  

**_Low-key, I'm alright  
Would you say you depend on the weather?  
My sunshine  
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out  
I know it's hard to believe me, it's a good day_**  

**_Today's a good day, never know, never know  
When the next one will show, it'll show  
So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul (Da-da-da)  
Today's a good day, never know, never know  
When the next one will show, it'll show  
So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul, yeah  
(So I'ma sing my soul, I'ma sing my soul)_**  

**_I'm alright  
Would you say you depend on the weather?  
My sunshine  
Is a buzz and a light, I'll be singing out  
I know it's hard to believe me, it's a good day_**  

**_I'm alright  
I'm alright  
I think that I'm alright  
It's a good day_**  

Я в порядке,  
Я в порядке,  
Думаю, я в порядку,  
Сегодня хороший день

“Good Day” starts off Scaled And Icy on a different note than other first tracks seen on twenty one pilots’ albums. Whereas “Jumpsuit,” “Heavydirtysoul,” and “Ode to Sleep” immediately start off strong, “Good Day” begins with a bright piano riff reminiscent of Elton John’s style, and builds in sound as the song progresses. Frontman Tyler Joseph shared in an interview that he did so with live shows in mind, imagining the song “kicking on section by section” like lights in a warehouse.

The song is based on a thought experiment Tyler had where he wondered how he’d react if he suddenly lost everyone he held dear to him (i.e. his wife and daughter). His reaction here is one of shock and denial (the first stage of grief) as he sings out that “it’s a good day,” despite what has occurred.  

Tyler Joseph:  
_This song is about getting to a place where if I were to lose everything, if I lost my wife and my kid, how would I in the first week react to that? And I think that what I would be is overly positive, like it’s fine–there’s a reason for everything. I’m okay. I even put a specific time on it. Like, I feel like a lot of stuff, anytime you go on vacation, something weird might happen, like someone comes down with some weird sickness. I’ve had a couple of weird things happen to my family while on vacation and I don’t know if that’s just me or if other people have experienced that. Maybe you’re in a new place, you don’t have your rhythm normal, and something happens, but the idea of–I was trying to put myself there. Like how would I react to some terrible thing happening over, you know, a vacation that we were all on and it was a really dark place to go…I would imagine that one of those stages of grief would feel a little bit like this song…I wanted to try to put a time stamp on what that period of grief might feel like._
