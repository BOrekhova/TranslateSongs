**_We come for you, no chances  
We come for you, no chances_**  

**_In my house shoes in a foot race  
In this house, we got feng shui  
Get the door to blow you away  
Flamethrower, you a switchblade  
Feet planted on grip tape  
With my shoulders squared and my back straight  
Got a good base and a loose tongue  
Notorious in the octagon, now_**  
 
**_Mm, ba-da-dum-ba-da-dum-bum  
We got people on the way  
We want you home in one piece now (Run away, run away)  
Mm, ba-da-dum-ba-da-dum-bum  
We get bodies every day  
We want you home in one piece now_**  

**_We come for you, no chances  
We come for you, no chances_**  

**_How'd you get the location? Put together pieces?  
They say they sell the information  
In those terms of agreement  
We spent some weekends on the grind  
Surveillances outside, we see when you arrive  
Ride or die, my son  
Spent some weekends on the grind  
Surveillances outside, we see when you arrive  
Ride or die, my son_**
