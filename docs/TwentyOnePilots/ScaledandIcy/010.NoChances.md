**No Chances**
<p>
Twenty One Pilots / Album Scaled and Icy
</p>  
----------------------------------------

**_We come for you, no chances  
We come for you, no chances_**  

Мы идём за тобой, у тебя нет шансов!  
Мы идём за вами, без шансов!{1}  

**_In my house shoes in a foot race  
In this house, we got feng shui  
Get the door to blow you away  
Flamethrower, you a switchblade  
Feet planted on grip tape  
With my shoulders squared and my back straight  
Got a good base and a loose tongue  
Notorious in the octagon, now_**  

Участвую в забеге в домашней обуви,  
В этом доме у нас всё по фэн-шую,{2}  
Открою дверь, чтобы тебя сдул ветер,  
Огнемёт против складного ножа,  
Стоя на скейтборде  
С расправленной спиной,  
Хорошей базой и языком без костей,  
И печальной популярностью в Октогоне{3}  

**_Mm, ba-da-dum-ba-da-dum-bum  
We got people on the way  
We want you home in one piece now (Run away, run away)  
Mm, ba-da-dum-ba-da-dum-bum  
We get bodies every day  
We want you home in one piece now_**  

**_We come for you, no chances  
We come for you, no chances_**  

**_How'd you get the location? Put together pieces?  
They say they sell the information  
In those terms of agreement  
We spent some weekends on the grind  
Surveillances outside, we see when you arrive  
Ride or die, my son  
Spent some weekends on the grind  
Surveillances outside, we see when you arrive  
Ride or die, my son_**

> {1} - Данные строки произносятся епископами из вымышленного города Дема, который фигурировал в песнях с предыдущего альбома twenty one pilots "Trench". Эти слова обращены к тем, кто осмелился сбежать из этого города. В записи этого фрагмента участвовали брат Тайлера и его друзья.  
> {2} - Фэншуй – даосская практика символического освоения пространства. С помощью фэншуй якобы можно выбрать "наилучшее" место для строительства дома или захоронения. Заявленная цель фэншуй – поиск благоприятных потоков энергии ци и их использование на благо человека.

**“No Chances”** is thought to be one of the songs on Scaled And Icy that connects to twenty one pilots' previous LP, Trench, a concept album set in a fictional city called Dema.  
**“No Chances”** is likely a sequel to the 3-part music video trilogy from Trench where Tyler tries to escape the city–a metaphor for mental illness–and, therefore, escape from the darkest thoughts in his head. Whereas Trench tells the story of Tyler and the other banditos, here we see the response of the nine bishops who rule over Dema to those trying to escape.  
**“No Chances”** sound contrasts the bishops' duplicitous intentions–heard as a chant on the bridge–with a softer, more melodic chorus to trick those considering leaving into believing the bishops' motives are more pure. After all, “SAI is propaganda.”  
Tyler shared with Apple Music that the chants were heavily inspired by crowds at stadiums, and he recruited his brother along with a few of his friends to sing them on the track.

**Tyler Joseph:**  
_I recruited my brother and a few of his friends to come over and record gang vocals. You have this microphone in the middle of the room and I have everyone in headphones and I’m kind of directing them in what to say and what to yell. That was the first time I’d ever really produced a room full of people. I was thinking of athletics and college sports specifically, where there’s overwhelmingly this hometown crowd, and how intimidating that can be and powerful that is in the face of opposition. I definitely was writing from that–I felt the energy of a gymnasium of a stadium and was wanting to capture that._
