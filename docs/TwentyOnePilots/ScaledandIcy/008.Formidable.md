----------------------------------------

**_You are formidable to me  
'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you  
But you should know I might be cynical towards you  
But I just can't believe that I'm for you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you  
Just let me know (Yeah)_**  

Для меня ты потрясающий,  
Ведь кажется, что ты знаешь это, куда не пошёл бы,  
Да да да я пойду за тобой,  
Но ты должен знать, я могу быть циничным по отношению к тебе,  
Просто я не могу поверить

**_And I know that we just met  
But could you take me everywhere you've ever been?  
I wanna see it all, no surprises, yeah_**  

**_You are formidable to me  
'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you  
But you should know I might bе clinical, don't you tell  
I won't break your heart if you can brеak my spell  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you  
Just let me know_**  

**_Fast-forward thirteen years now  
Don't know what it was, but somehow we played it out in reverse  
I'm afraid of you now, more than I was at first  
And I know you just left, but can I take you everywhere we've ever been?  
I wanna see it all, no surprises, yeah_**  

**_You are formidable to me  
'Cause you seem to know it, where you wanna go  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll follow you  
But you should know I might be cynical towards you  
I'm just worried my loyalty will bore you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you  
Just let me know_**  

**_Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can die with you  
Just let me know_**
