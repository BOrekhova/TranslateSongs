**_Slow down on Monday  
Not a sound on Wednesday, yeah  
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday  
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
We paint the town_**  
**_Slow down on Monday

**_Lose my sense a time or two  
Weeks feel like days  
Medicate in the afternoon  
And I just want to know;  
Have you lost your footing, too?  
I just pray that I'm not losing you_**  

**_Catch me floatin' circles in my fishbowl  
Keep things fresh  
She said that I should change my clothes  
I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, oh_**

**_Ooh, you're good  
These are my dancin' shoes  
We paint the town  
Ooh, you're good  
Thought I would dance with you  
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday  
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
We paint the town_**  

**_(Feelin' great)  
Life moves slow on the ocean floor  
(Feelin' great)  
I can't feel the waves anymore  
Did the tide forget to move?  
I just pray that I'm not losin' you_**  

**_Catch me floatin' circles in my fishbowl  
Keep things fresh  
She said that I should change my clothes  
I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, yeah_**  

**_Workin' on music?  
Yeah  
I-I'll just go to bed, I'm tired  
I wanna watch Friends with you  
Oh, if you feel like you have time to do a song or you're inspired  
You should just go for it_**  

**_(Oh) Slow down on Monday (Yeah, yeah)  
Not a sound on Wednesday  
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday  
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
We paint the town_**  

**_Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  
We paint the, on  
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday  
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday_**

**“Saturday”** is the third single off of twenty one pilots' album, Scaled And Icy. It is frontman Tyler Joseph’s first collaboration with producer Greg Kurstin, who has won multiple Grammys for working with the likes of major stars such as Adele and Beck, and his touch adds a more poppy and upbeat feel to the song compared to twenty one pilots' usual sound.  
While “Saturday” is not an explicit love song, frontman Tyler Joseph paints a picture of love for his wife, Jenna Joseph, and how she kept him going through the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Like the lead single “Shy Away,” “Saturday” was released without any prior promotion.  

**Tyler Joseph:**  
_When you strip away what day of the week it is, you lose your rhythm. You lose your sense of what is up and what is down. And that’s a lesson that [drummer] Josh [Dun] and I learned pretty quickly on tour, because a Friday night and a Monday night could feel the exact same, whether or not we had a show. When the pandemic happened, everything’s shut down, everyone was starting to learn that same lesson, where the days of the week lose their meaning, and it was messing with people’s reference of time. You feel like you’re swirling and your feet aren’t planted. The song is really, I’m talking to my wife, hoping that she sticks with me, even though I’m working through this, even though I’m kind of tumbling into nothingness._
