**_Slow down on Monday  
Not a sound on Wednesday, yeah  
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday  
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
We paint the town_**

**_Lose my sense a time or two  
Weeks feel like days  
Medicate in the afternoon  
And I just want to know;  
Have you lost your footing, too?  
I just pray that I'm not losing you_**  

**_Catch me floatin' circles in my fishbowl  
Keep things fresh  
She said that I should change my clothes  
I exaggerate the life we used to know, oh, oh_**

**_Ooh, you're good  
These are my dancin' shoes  
We paint the town  
Ooh, you're good  
Thought I would dance with you  
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday  
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday  
We paint the town_**  

**_(Feelin' great)  
Life moves slow on the ocean floor  
(Feelin' great)  
I can't feel the waves anymore  
Did the tide forget to move?  
I just pray that I'm not losin' you_**

**_Workin' on music?  
Yeah  
I-I'll just go to bed, I'm tired  
I wanna watch Friends with you  
Oh, if you feel like you have time to do a song or you're inspired  
You should just go for it_**  

**_(Oh) Slow down on Monday (Yeah, yeah)  
Not a sound on Wednesday  
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday  
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday

**_Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da  
We paint the, on  
Might get loud (Ayy) on Friday  
But on Saturday, Saturday, Saturday_**
