Twenty One Pilots / Scaled and Icy
=========================

Scaled and Icy is the highly anticipated sixth album from twenty one pilots, expected May 21st, 2021.

Speculation about the album’s cover art and release began on April 5, 2021, when a tweet from a popular twenty one pilots fan’s Twitter account surfaced appearing to show a promotional advertisement for Scaled and Icy embedded into dmaorg.info, a hotspot for the lore and storyline surrounding Trench. Indeed, the album’s title is an anagram of “Clancy is dead”—a reference to the character from the Trench universe.

The first single “Shy Away” was released without any prior promotion on April 7, 2021, along with the full tracklist for the album. On April 28, 2021, twenty one pilots announced the release of their second single, “Choker,” two days prior to its release.

On the album’s sound, Tyler shared in a 2021 interview with Kerrang!: _What you’re inundated with [at fist] is shiny, and colorful, and seemingly upbeat. But, as always, as you dive into lyrics, a lot of times it’s asking some pretty heavy questions and addressing some pretty heavy things. That was intentional._

>_**What has Tyler said about the album?**_  
_As you move about your life, you imagine that you start to answer more and more questions, inevitably there’s going to be a time where I have no more to say, and I’ve always wondered when that’s gonna be. And, all of a sudden, I began to be inspired by something else – whether it’s my daughter now._
_If you’ve noticed with some of our previous releases there’s always a bigger story to everything that’s being created, and this record particularly is more colourful than other records – literally more colourful, and hopefully sonically as well.  
That colour is supposed to represent the unleashing of an imagination. You know, I have this theory that, even if you’re confined to one small room, if you were to focus on one singular detail of that room, that detail can then come to life. Actually, I have this little dragon totem figurine that I’ve been staring at, and my theory is that if I can get to a place where I’m looking at him and I’m creating something, and all of a sudden he can grow and actually fly around the room, and then where I am I can actually transport it to a completely different place… It really is the power of creativity, the power of imagination, and, ultimately, the power of music._

> _**What has Tyler said about the meaning of the album's title?**_  
_The word ‘scaled’ and ‘icy’ actually stands for ‘scale back’ and ‘isolated’, which is kind of how we all found ourselves this past year— scaled back and isolated. And so I took those two words that were very, I dunno, negative. And I tried to put a spin on it that was the opposite of (it), and when I thought of ‘scaled and icy’, which is shortened versions of the word scaled back and isolated, I just immediately thought of this dragon. And so he really brings home why we named the record “Scaled and Icy” and I think that when you listen to the full record, it’ll start to make sense._

> **_What did Tyler say about the story behind the album?_**  
_I’ve always felt like it’s a real waste of an opportunity to not be creating a story inside of music, and even when I first started writing songs I knew I wanted to attach something larger to it. But, at the same time, Josh and I have always talked about not wanting there to be a prerequisite to enjoy the songs; we don’t want you to have to know all the details of the story thus far in order to really enjoy and find something that means something to you inside of a song._
