[Verse 1: O_Super]
Boil water for my French press
Light an L to alleviate the head stress
My emotions roll over like the head rest
On the plane I connected under sunsets
Start a rhyme for the time I got nothing left
Moms screaming, time's beaming, gotta make the best
Out this holiday weekend, what a success
I’m not high this evening, what an upset
Which flight will get me lifted where the sun rest?
Time zones, don't know if she up yet
Google drone, Metro phone, what's the subset?
Finding out on your location what is obsessed?
I’m just kidding for the moment, maybe not yet
Steady chasing your reflection, so eternal yet
She was mountainous like Denver
It's cold inside this rental
Oh, how you would November
Hug me tighter in the winter
Sweater sessions, touching linen
Fire burning on your shoulder, you remember
That our life is all worth living
Even in times of forgiveness
It hurts to be so cold
Seeing you warm within December
Without your favorite nigga
Bob could probably paint the pictures
Flowers on your windows
Because you're my favorite art
You're my canvas, you're my heart
On this tablet I forgot
All this love from the start
Has got me thinking of this since we are apart
Hey
[Chorus]
Never (Never), ahh (Never)
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh
Never (Never), ahh (Never)
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh

[Verse 2: Mag.Lo]
Let's get this poppin', fam, I'm ready for the world tour
Showed me two options so I had to take the third door
Had to take some time to analyze what really hurts more
Vacant from the nine to five or being poor and goin’ for it
Some say I’ll be without, but time is all we really have
Walkin' round, hazy vision living in a time lapse
We were never meant for that, I admire mama, spent her life
So my environment’s conducive to aspiring, she's ironclad
When life strikes, she fires back
Resilient despite my dad's absence, oh, I admire that
I got my CDs, my tees and my flyers packed
This is for my young lads and those who love my prior acts
Lump me with the 2010 kids who rap sad and act cathartic
Middle class aggression once expressed through wack guitar riffs
Too profound, leave a passerby so astounded
Why this kid lost his shit in the parking lot of Target?
Man, it's deeper than that
And this ain’t for the niggas who would tweet before act
This is for my people out of reach of relief, can't speak so they rap
For the tongue tied young minds out seekin' a gat
Holdin' on to they sanity while we preachin' our sentiments
Of lovin' humanity while they can't see the evidence
Been through the ringer of self-doubt and depression
It ain't a preference, I hope they hear me, 'cause I'll be here tellin' them that
[Chorus]
Never (Never), ahh (Never)
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh
Never (Never), ahh (Never)
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh

[Bridge: Mag.Lo]
Turbulence (Turbulence)
Is more than mere disturbances
Helps you learn to yearn for life
To reassess your worth and shit
Keep it in (Balance)
Try to have a (Good time)
Treat yourself and seek some help (And you'll be just fine)
Turbulence (Turbulence)
Is more than mere disturbances
Helps you learn to yearn for life
To reassess your worth and shit
Keep it in (Balance)
Try to have a (Good time)
Don't forget to be yourself (And you'll be just fine)

[Refrain: Mag.Lo]
I'll be just fine
