**_[Carol]  
Teaching at the school  
Feeling like a fool  
Tell me, what did I do wrong?  
Everybody used to love my songs  
But now I'm just a teacher mom!_**

What a big mistake  
My taking in an ape  
Killed my rock and rollin' dreams  
The boy belongs in big tall trees and me  
Well I belong in [MSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schenker_Group)_**

Wake up the kid!  
Good morning, it's breakfast!  
I know how you like your bananas  
Quit with the screeching!  
School's in an hour!

You'll be multiplying  
You're gonna like your new school!_**

**_[Carol & Bill]  
Shane he doesn't know  
That very long ago  
When Dad and I were still quite thin  
Oh, we came upon a baby chimp  
Decided that we'd take it in  
Forgetting all our dreams  
We took him and it seemed  
We had a little family  
For seven hundred bucks a week, I teach  
And it pays for all the food Shane eats  
And he eats a lot!_**

> _**What have the artists said about the song?**_  
It‚Äôs very simple. It could have been her up on the stage. It could have been her, if it weren‚Äôt for the chimp in the cage. This song uncovers the unholy truth that Shane is in fact a chimpanzee, and not a human boy. In an attempt to compensate for the loss of their baby, Bill and Carol took in a young chimp, not knowing what they were in for. We find out that Carol had a hard knock hard rock past, that she should have been a star, that she could have been a star, if it hadn‚Äôt been for Shane. My mother Susan Hall sings it. Beautifully!
